A native, zero-compromise real-time 3D spatial audio companion for **Euro Truck Simulator 2** on **macOS** and **Windows (64-bit)**. 

ETS2 Cabin Radio attaches directly to FMOD's `bus:/radio` channel inside the running game process to simulate an authentic 4.1-speaker truck/car cabin soundstage—**without modifying game executables, MP3 files, saves, game archives, or code signatures**.

## ✨ Features

- **4.1-Speaker Physical Cabin Acoustic Simulation**:
  - **Front Left (FL)**: Dash & door speaker positioned near the driver.
  - **Front Right (FR)**: Passenger-side dash speaker with realistic cross-cab Haas acoustic propagation delay.
  - **Rear Left (RL) & Rear Right (RR)**: B-pillar and sleeper berth surround speakers for full spatial immersion.
  - **Subwoofer Pressure**: Under-seat low-frequency resonance modeling.
  - **Early Reflections**: 4-tap reflection model simulating windshield, side glass, and rear sleeper back-wall acoustics.

- **Dynamic 360° Binaural Spatialization**:
  - **Fractional-Sample ITD (Interaural Time Difference)**: Accurately shifts sound arrival between ears as you pan your view.
  - **2-Band Head Shadowing**: Low-frequency diffraction vs. high-frequency occlusion when looking away from dashboard speakers.
  - **Front/Back Pinna Directivity**: Seamlessly responds to 360° interior cabin camera rotation (`cabin_rot`).

- **Real-Time Glass & Window Aerodynamics**:
  - Dynamically responds to left and right electric windows (`wnd_left`, `wnd_right`).
  - Models realistic acoustic pressure drop and exterior environmental wind bleed when opening windows or leaning out (`cabin_out`).

- **Live Hot-Reloading**:
  - Switch between presets (**Premium**, **Warm**, **Stock Radio**, **Spatial**) and adjust intensity, sleeper balance, or dashboard position on the fly—even while driving at 90 km/h.

- **Zero-Footprint Non-Destructive Hooking**:
  - Leaves game files, audio files, Steam achievements, and telemetry untouched.
  - Leaves game engine sounds, turbo spool, tire noise, and ambient world audio buses completely unaffected.

## 🎛️ Sound Presets

| Preset | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Premium** | High-fidelity sound system with clear treble, tight low-end, and subtle studio cabin reflections. |
| **Warm** | Smooth analog curve with rich midrange and rounded low frequencies, optimized for long nighttime highway drives. |
| **Stock Radio** | Factory dashboard paper-cone speakers with authentic midrange coloration and gentle compression. |
| **Spatial** | Maximized stereo width and enhanced early cabin reflections for maximum 3D acoustic immersion. |

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 🍏 macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel)

1. Download **`ETS2-Cabin-Radio-v1.2.0-macOS.zip`** from [Releases](https://github.com/uawannacry/ets2-spatial-radio/releases).
2. Unzip and drag **`ETS2 Cabin Radio.app`** to your `/Applications` folder.
3. Open **`ETS2 Cabin Radio.app`** and click **Launch ETS2 with Live DSP**.
4. Adjust sound profile, cabin intensity, and driver position at any time in the companion window.
5. Diagnostic logs are written in real time to:
   ```text
   ~/Library/Logs/ETS2 Cabin Radio/live-dsp.log
   ```

---

### 🪟 Windows (64-bit)

1. Download **`ETS2-Cabin-Radio-v1.2.0-Windows-x64.zip`** from [Releases](https://github.com/uawannacry/ets2-spatial-radio/releases).
2. Extract the folder. Keep `ETS2 Cabin Radio.exe` and `ETS2CabinDSP.dll` together in the same directory.
3. Run **`ETS2 Cabin Radio.exe`**.

You have two launch options:

- **Option A: Portable Live Attach (Zero files in game folder)**:
  - Click **Launch / Attach Live DSP**.
  - Works both to launch ETS2 directly, or to attach live into an already running `eurotrucks2.exe` session without restarting the game.
- **Option B: Steam Auto-Plugin**:
  - Click **Install Steam Auto-Plugin** inside the launcher (or copy `ETS2CabinDSP.dll` to your `<Steam>\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\bin\win_x64\plugins\` folder).
  - ETS2 will automatically load the live cabin DSP whenever you launch the game from Steam or desktop shortcuts.

Diagnostics and runtime configurations are stored at:
```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\ETS2 Cabin Radio\live-dsp.log
```

## 🛠️ Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
- **Windows / Cross-compiling**: [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) compiler (for cross-compiling Windows x64 binaries from macOS/Linux), or MSVC (Visual Studio / Build Tools).

### macOS Build

Run the automated build script:
```bash
chmod +x build-macos.sh
./build-macos.sh
```

Or run manual commands:
```bash
# 1. Compile SwiftUI frontend launcher
swiftc -parse-as-library -swift-version 5 \
  -sdk "$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)" \
  -target arm64-apple-macos13.0 \
  -framework SwiftUI -framework AppKit \
  -o ETS2CabinRadio main.swift

# 2. Compile Live DSP injection library
clang -dynamiclib -O2 -Wall -Wextra -arch x86_64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.13 \
  -Wl,-undefined,dynamic_lookup -install_name '@rpath/libETS2CabinDSP.dylib' \
  -o libETS2CabinDSP.dylib LiveCabinDSP.c
```

### Windows x64 Build

Run the automated cross-compile script:
```bash
chmod +x build-windows.sh
./build-windows.sh
```

Or run manual commands:
```bash
# 1. Compile Windows 64-bit Live DSP DLL
zig cc -target x86_64-windows-gnu -shared -O2 -Wall -Wextra \
  -o ETS2CabinDSP.dll LiveCabinDSP.c

# 2. Compile Windows 64-bit GUI Launcher
zig cc -target x86_64-windows-gnu -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Wl,--subsystem,windows \
  -o "ETS2 Cabin Radio.exe" windows_main.c app.res \
  -lcomctl32 -lcomdlg32 -lshell32 -lshlwapi -lgdi32 -luser32 -ladvapi32
```
